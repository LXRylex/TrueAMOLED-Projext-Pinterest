# TrueAMOLED - Pinterest

Tired of “dark mode” extensions that leave half of Pinterest glowing white or break every other fucking update?
**TrueAMOLED - Pinterest** is a *CSS-only* theme that actually does the job as goddamn god intended.

## 💀 Why this exists

Most awful "Pinterest dark/black" extensions:

- Only style the home feed and ignore popups, menus, comments, and edit screens.
- Leave random white cards, borders, and dialog boxes burning your eyes.
- Break as soon as Pinterest tweaks a class name.
- Slap on one generic stylesheet and call it a day. WELL FUCK IT!1!1!!

**TrueAMOLED - Pinterest** is built specifically around Pinterest’s real UI pieces and provides the best dark mode experience

## 🌑 What TrueAMOLED changes

- **Global pure black background**  
  Main app root, vertical nav, top bar, dialogs, popups, dropdowns etc and A WHOLLA LOT MORE!

- **List of some fixes**  
  - Black Texts > White  
  - Links etc > Purple  
  - Buttons like Save, Profile, Refresh, Suggestions etc all adapted to black properly
  - User Comments Names > White texts
  - Pinterest Profile Settings > White texts

- **Custom scrollbar**  
  - A better stylized scrollbar to fit with the theme

- **Gets rid of the "Discover"**  
  - Hides the **Discover** seems poinless to me if there is a demand i may add it back

All of this lives in **one CSS file** and works locally on your PUTER! [Computer]

Developer Note: Holy shit these are BROKEN AS FUCK LOL


## ⚙️ Install (Chromium)

1. Extract the .zip
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder.
5. Open Pinterest and refresh.

If you still see white chunks, Pinterest probably changed something try to CTRL+R it will hard refresh, if it does not work report with a screenshot and i'll patch it as quick as possible if it can be done because some elements are hard to turn to black
